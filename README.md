# Dimensionality Reduction using an Autoencoder in Python 
This is a practical part of a project created by Coursera Project Network.
It introduces the theory behind an autoencoder (AE), its uses, and its advantages over PCA, a common dimensionality reduction technique.

## Project Objectives
 - Generate and preprocess high-dimensional data
 - Use cleaned data to create a PCA baseline model
 - How an autoencoder works
 - How to train an autoencoder in scikit-learn
 - How to extract encoder from trained autoencoder
 - How to evaluate dimensionality reduction using visual and analytical approaches
